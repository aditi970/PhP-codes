Basic PhP codes

This repository contains a collection of basic PHP programs demonstrating foundational backend concepts, database connectivity, and simple data-processing logic. Each file focuses on a specific functionality, making the project useful for beginners learning PHP or anyone revising core server-side programming techniques.

The project includes scripts for validating inputs, interacting with a database, filtering data, and displaying stored records. For example, the *Check if Course Code Exists* script shows how to verify data against a database, while *Database Connection.php* demonstrates establishing a secure connection using MySQLi. The *Display Books* module retrieves and prints book records from the database, highlighting how to execute queries and loop through results. Additionally, the *Filter Even Numbers* program applies backend logic to process numerical input, and the *Process Event Feedback* files handle user-submitted form data, showcasing the basics of form handling, input validation, and response generation.

Overall, the project serves as a simple but effective introduction to PHP-based backend development. It helps learners understand database interaction, conditional processing, user input handling, and modular coding structure. The code is kept clean, functional, and beginner-friendly to support academic, practice, or portfolio purposes.
